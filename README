Evolution through natural selection of neural networks.
Three types of creatures:
1) Green plants grow randomly.
2) Blue herbivores eat plants.
3) Red carnivores eat herbivores.

=== Controls ===
<space>       Toggle between normal rendered speed and fast no-render speed.
<right-click> Pause, move forward by one frame.
<left-click>  Select/unselect an entity.
<a>           Select all entities.
<c>           Clear all selections.
<s>           Toggle extra rendering of selected entities
                  Render nothing extra.
                  Render left/right vision circles.
                  Render left/right RGB inputs and current health.
<0-9>         Change the rate of mutation.  0 = no mutation, 9 = max mutation.  Mutations occur only upon reproduction.

Every 10000 generations a GEN5 file is created for herbivores and carnivores to save the state of the neural network at that time.

Minimizing the window hides it to the system tray.  Clicking on the tray icon brings it back.  Closing the window saves the latest genes to file and exits.

The process runs at idle priority.

=== Neural network details ===
The herbivores and carnivores brains process the same inputs and outputs.

IN: Left eye red color
IN: Left eye green color
IN: Left eye blue color
IN: Right eye red color
IN: Right eye green color
IN: Right eye blue color
IN: Current health
IN: Current radius of eyes
IN: Feedback of last forward/backward displacement OUT 
IN: Feedback of last rotation OUT
IN: Feedback of last eye radius delta OUT
IN: Feedback of last delta of body radius OUT

OUT: Relative forward/backward movement
OUT: Relative change in rotation
OUT: Relative change in eye radius
OUT: Relative change in body radius

=== Results ===

~80000 generations I usually see the herbivores properly hunt for the plants.

I've seen herbivores simulateously reduce the radius of their eyes and the angle between them to focus on a single plant as they approached it.  Presumable this was an improvement over earlier generations which would get confused between a close plant and two or more far ones.

I've seen herbivores actively evade carnivores, stopping in mid movement and quickly backing up.

I've seen carnivores actively target herbivores.

I've seen herbivores reduce their size when evading a carnivore to reduce the chances of a collision and increase their size when going towards a plant.
